# Trivia Game

### Week 5 Homework
**About This Homework**

This project is a trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.

The trivia is multiple choice.

There is a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. The game ends when the time runs out (or when the user hits "Submit").

The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

When the player is done, there's an option to "Play Again".
